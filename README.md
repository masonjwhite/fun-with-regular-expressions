# Fun With Regular Expressions

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

I must admit that I was one of those developers who always Googled "regular expression for X". Well I no longer wanted to do that! So I did a deep dive on regular expressions by following the Net Ninja's amazing tutorial series, located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6I-Ahc0HB4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD&index=1).

This repository is NOT intended to be a replacement to the series, but rather a companion repo and reminder for all of the tools we have in our regex toolbox!

## Structure
